                "cloud piano", a summary video of which you can view above, takes real time images
                of clouds and feeds that data through to be processed. The machine responds by 
                pressing piano keys corresponding to the real-time images it "sees". I really like this
                piece because I think art seeks to focus on nature's beauty and reflect it through the
                artist's medium of choice, and making the playing of an instrument depend not on a 
                constructed melody but on nature could open up discussion about patterns in nature 
                versus how we seek out patterns in musical media. This piece reminds me of the 
                algorithmic design project in this class, because instead of the artist setting the 
                rules that create an art piece, it feels more like the laws of nature are setting the 
                rules.

            Mauro Martino (the creator of this piece) used Google's Quick Draw dataset and 
            superimposed drawings of the same objects from different demographics. The purpose is to
            compare how people from different cultures draw the same objects. As linked in the 
            "summary" article below, some objects were drawn the same across cultures, as opposed to
            power outlets. Images of these examples, from the article, are also shown below. I chose 
            this piece because it's fascinating to examine the patterns in the way people draw shapes.
            Can something be said about the aggregate shape that is created by superimposed images, or
            about the order in which people tend to draw a certain object? Why do doodles different 
            depending on demographic information? The power outlet example is more obvious to me, but
            why do people tend to draw the upper line/eyelid of the human eye first?
